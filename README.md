# critboard
A Canvas extension for critiquing student-submitted images and video. Designed for use in class. Sort media onto one of three shelves.

This is a clone of the postem repo, except that the single app is the Critboard app. None of this has been tested, but all I'm really doing is 
replacing the code in findvalidtoken.php that does a complicated dance to identify the correct token to use with a straightforward 'your token here'
approach. Adopters are encouraged to take whatever steps they deem necessary to provide their token securely.

For developer docs, see the readme.html file inside the critboard subfolder.
